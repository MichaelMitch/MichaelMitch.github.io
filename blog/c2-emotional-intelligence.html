        <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter</h3>
        <p>
             The ideas about training attention, and it's ties to our emotional regulation struck a chord with me. The idea that in the process of building up your ability to focus you are much more lucid and aware to your reactions day to day. It never really clicked with me that a way to get more out of a conversation with someone is by meditation. If you are focused on the conversation instead of all your external worries it would obviously be more fruitful. The idea that you shouldn't be so wrapped up in personal issues is interesting to me. Wading through your problems means that you fail to use compassion when relating to other people, as you're mind is completely elsewhere. I think the book discusses further along about training yourself to ask the question when you meet or run into someone "how can I make this person happy?". This in turn can strenghten trust in your personal and professional relationships. It seems the book puts a great amount of faith on not exactly dis-association, but taking a step back from life, and looking at every issue that you come across in a more rational manner.

        <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
        <p>
            It was interesting. I went with what the book calls "The Easy Way" in that you focus on your breathing as you go throught the two minutes. I tried to focus my mind on the amount of time that I was breathing inhaling and exhaling, and tried to push out any other thoughts that tried to enter my mind. It's definitely hard to completely clear your mind for even as small a time as two minutes, but I find that noticing when your mind has wandered and correcting your thoughts is part of the whole training, so I wasn't too worried. It seems even after only two minutes of doing this you end up feeling much more relaxed. I find that I'm able to focus more of my attention on writing this than I was able to before doing so. I wasn't so sure about breaking up study or work into smaller chunks of time, but maybe doing something like this alongside the pomodoro method would actually maximize my efficiency when it comes to work.
