            <h3 class="blogcardtitle">How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h3>
            <p>
                I worked throught the re-design by focusing on the structure of the site rather than the end result. I tried to make sure the structure of the site was working before I started to fill it in with information. While going through, I made sure to backtrack a bit to check that everything was laid out in a way that complied with the skeleton structure that was provided, and I tried not to habitually check the code by refreshing the browser page unless it was extremely necessary.

            <h3 class="blogcardtitle">What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h3>
            <p>
                My thoughts on meditation was that it was just a tool for being able to hone your consentration. The act of it seemed to be that sitting for a couple of minutes undisturbed by any external influences would act as a reset for your attention. It seemed to be a way to collect yourself after a lengthy period of time working so that you don't get over-burdened with whatever it is you're creating or working on.

            <h3 class="blogcardtitle">What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h3>
            <p>
                The idea of being relaxed and alert at the same time. I thought the idea of meditation was soley for training to be focused in a relaxed state, and discarding any outside distractions. Learning to be both at peace with yourself and to take on board anything from outside, processing them, is new to me. I found the ideas of breathing I found interesting. Not treating meditation as a focus on your breathing, and instead using the breathing as a method of building up a rhythm. I thought the whole point of the breathing excercises was that it's supposed to be something you can focus on for a long amount of time as you meditate. That is partly true, thought it seems the whole point of meditiation is geared to the consentration aspect, and less on the breathing aspect.

            <h3 class="blogcardtitlle">Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
            <p>
                I learnt a lot about posturing as you meditate. I tried to sit in the posture that you would usually expect people to meditate in, i.e the cross legged position. Though this didn't really work for me as the circulation in my legs would usually cut off. I now instead lie flat on the ground, keeping my back straight against it. I may attempt to stretch myself out in the future to be able to sit in the default position, though it may be difficult. I am now not closing my eyes completely when I meditate. I realised that I was getting close to drifting into sleep when I was doing this. Realising you're about to fall asleep brings you out of your meditative state rather quickly. I now keep my eyes partly open, and I definitely see the benifits.

            <h3 class="blogcardtitlle">Any other musings?</h3>
            <p>
                I did some external reading on meditation. There seems to be another way to tackle your consentration and to delve into a deeper state if you're planning to meditate for a longer period of time. You start with the breathing technique as before, and once you feel you've entered a good zone, you start concentrating on a section of your body. for example, you consentrate on your toes or feet. When you do this you consentrate on what the feel like. if you're wearing socks you notice the feeling of that on them. after a while you should start to feel them disappear in a sense, such that you're so in tune with that body part you don't notice it that much. you continue to do this for your whole body while keeping your breathing in check. I've tried this on a couple of occasions and, while it is harder, It does seem to work well for an end of day wrap-up.
