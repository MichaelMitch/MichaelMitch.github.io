          <p>
              I was working on the redesign of my website, and realised the code I had written wasn't integrating with the skeleton code that was imported all that well. There was a box that I wanted to offset from the centre of the page, and the only main body container they provided had it set in the centre with all the code doing so being pulled from their site. The first thing I did was research the problem. Why wasn't the code I was writing overriding the code they had set out for me? is there a way to override it so it worked? what were the implications of doing so? After flicking though a few forums I decided the best way to set it up was to grab the code they had created and set up a new class to create the body with, taking the elements of their code that worked with everything else and making subtle changes. I felt a bit wrong doing so as I know that you're supposed to keep everything contained in the skeleton code, but it was going to be the only way my code would match the wireframe I set out for myself.

          <p>
              <b>Pseudocode:</b> This I use when I first set up to write a large function or block of code. handy as a reference for what you're actually trying to do, and acts as pre-built comments so thats cool as well.       </br>
              <b>Trying Something:</b> Usually the method I choose. How else are you going to figure out what's wrong if you don't try anything?       </br>
              <b>Rubber Ducky Method:</b> Not something I'm used to trying. I'm ok with referencing the pseudocode as a way to talk myself through what I'm trying to achieve       </br>
              <b>Reading Error Messages:</b> Super handy for when you misstype something. usually my first port of call when something is just straight up broken        </br>
              <b>Console Logging:</b> Something I definitely use. handy for when you need to tell if a function is actually being called, or what part of your code is actually being parsed.        </br>
              <b>Googling:</b> Usually something I use if I forget syntax of something. I guess when these things start commiting to memory it won't be used as often, though something that's still handy to have around        </br>
              <b>Asking Peers For Help:</b>  Not something I really do. I don't really want to be a burden on others when I know I'll be able to figure it out in time.       </br>
              <b>Asking Coaches For Help:</b> See above        </br>
              <b>Improving Your Process With Reflection:</b> Reflection is great. It's good to follow up your work with ideas on where you need improving. I can already tell you now that in retrospect I should probably comment in my code more, and so it's something I'm working on.      </br>
