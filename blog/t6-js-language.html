          <p>
              <b>Parentheses ()</b> 
              Parentheses are used when passing values to a function, even if the function needs nothing passed to it to work. when writing out values to pass to a variable, you would use parentheses to make sure your math is correct and following the correct rules. They are used when you write any logic based code. I-e if ((A and B) or (C and D)). They are basically used when you need to sort out any information before it gets used, or to create any conditions. 
                </br>

              <b> brackets []</b> 
              Brackets are used in the realm of arrays. to create an array you would use bracket notation i = []. to get an item from an array you would use i[0]. along with arrays they work with objects to get information you would need from them. They are basically an indexer.
                </br>

              <b>braces {}</b> 
                Braces are used to specify what happens when something is called upon. When a function is called you would use brackets to determine everything that happens as the function runs it's course. Braces are also used to determine objects. all the info about a certian object is contained in the brackets of it. They work to section off code and to house the info for more detailed variables
                </br>

              <b>single quotes '' and double quotes " "</b>
                Used for when you are creating strings. they are sometimes used, especially when it comes to event listeners, to determine the type of event you want to listen to. 'mouseClick'. They are interchangeable with double quotes, though if you know that the string will need to include inline double quotes, you would use single quotes to house it, so that the string doesn't think you've ended it pre-maturely. you can however use inline notation with back slashes If you end ups needing both types of quotes in a string.
