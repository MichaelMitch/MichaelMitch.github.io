    <h1>Thoughts After Watching the Fireside Talk</h1>
    
    <h3>What's your take on the DBC/EDA experience?</h3>
    <p>
        My initial take on the EDA experience is somewhat like a university course.  
        I can tell that there are differences with the whole wellbeing aspect but other than that it seems there are assignments and a structure.
        The focus on creating instead of learning theory does differ to the usual teaching styles and that does seem like a positive. 
    </p>
    <h3>What are your impressions?</h3> 
    <p>
        I see that the course is definitely focused on on collaboration.
        There does seem to be pretty regular checkups.
        While there is a lot of coding and a lot of information to learn in the realm of web development, it seems the course develops your ability to navigate the ins and outs of the industry.
        There does seem to be a lot of work to get through, but I feel that I am in a good position to achieve what is expected of me.
    </p>
    <h3>How do you see yourself engaging with this type of culture?</h3>
    <p>
        The aspect of working with others may be a bit of a challenge as the work I have done in the past, especially in tech, I have mainly been isolated.
        I believe that once I get aquainted with the rest of my quohort and build up a rapport, I'll be able to get a stronger foothold in the course.
        Communicating with the rest of my peers, and learning that I am able to lean on them if I need support is something I'll have to focus on.
    </p>
    <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed? If so, how?</h3>
    <p>
        I expected the first stage of the course ie the phase 0 to be a learn on your own time, and do your own work sort of your style. The second half I expected to be working closely with others.
        It seems that they are both about equal with how much you should be collaborating.
        I will have to set a solid schedule to make sure I'm not falling behind. I'll try find a way to share this schedule so that people will know when I'm online, and I can work alonside people.
    </p>
    <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>
    <p>
        I'm a mix of excited and nervous about this course. mostly about similar reasons.
        I'm nervous about working alongside people and making sure that I'm meeting expectations. I'm excited about meeting new people and building lasting relationships with the people I work with and will be in the same industry.
        I'm nervous abouot the workload and the time dedication to getting through it. I'm excited about the possibilities coming out of the course, and the journey coming through it.
