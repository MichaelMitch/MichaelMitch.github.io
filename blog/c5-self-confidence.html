          <h3 class="blogcardtitle">What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
          <p>
              Mindfulness is the the ability to pay attention to what's going around you, both internally and externally. Self Awareness is the ability to apply mindfulness to yourself in these regards, in order to control your emotions or to self reflect on what you are doing. They are very similar, in that they both deal with introspective awareness, though self awareness deals more on the self, and emotions, being able to pick up on changes in your body in different circumstances.

          <h3 class="blogcardtitle"> Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling). What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h3>
          <p>
              I tried the body scanning, as I may have detailed in the last blog I had heard of this technique before, and have been using it on and off without really knowing it had much to do with mindfulness and self awareness training. I just believed it was a diffent way of meditation, which I guess it is in a way. I definitely enjoy this type of meditation, though when I found it I did not know about thinking of a positive thought as you are in your relaxed state to see how different aspects of yourself change. I tried it and noticed that my breathing becomes much deeper, and my muscles are noticeably relaxed.

            <h3 class="blogcardtitle"> What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
            <p>
                The thought had never really occured to me. I have always thought of myself as a shy and/or nervous person. If I can learn to manage those emotions it would be extremely beneficial. Training up my self awareness and Self consciousness to do so seems a much more appealing idea.
