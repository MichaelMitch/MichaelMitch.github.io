          <h3 class="blogcardtitle">What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'? How did the other person find it?</h3>
          <p>
            I learnt about the importance of understanding. I didn't realise that while talking to someone, the actual message of what you are trying to convey may not be completely understood by the other person. Looping seems a good way to allow yourself to justify the intention of what you've just said to the other person. The idea of allowing four or so minutes to allow either yourself or the person you're talking to makes for a good idea. Sometimes conversations can become extremely one-sided, depending on who's speaking. allowing everyone a fair share of time to input ideas may result in a change in course for the better, whether it be what the discussion is about or what is being discussed. "Dipping" seems like it would be the hardest part of mindfulness conversation. So many times I find myself trying to put meaning to what has been said or just wrap myself up in thoughts about a conversation without actually paying attention to what has been said. I would be beneficial to learn how to let go of your thoughts while listening, to fully understand the other person. Then you can internalise the infomation after.

          <h3 class="blogcardtitle">Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h3>
          <p>
            I'm going to start with the "one breath a day" technique, and might incorporate others after time. Doing so will allow me to relax about the whole meditation process, and let go of my worries about how much time I should be dedicating to mindfulness excercises. I like the idea of training it into a habit. If I can set aside time for one breath and keep that up, I can slowly start to increase the time spent consentrating on my breathing until I have a steady habit of more than just one breath. Even if it is a bit slow at the start, At least I am dedicating some time towards it.

            <p>
                I definitely like the idea of circuit training your meditation. When I try consentrate on just breathing for an extended period of time, I often find myself getting frustrated at losing consentration. Even though I know you're supposed to let those feelings go, after a while it starts to stack. Stopping for a breif period to meditate by just letting yourself experience your being seems like a good way to reset your breathing meditation and let your frustrations go. I think the trick would be to find the right balance to each side, to make sure you're dedicating enough time to the breathing techniques.
