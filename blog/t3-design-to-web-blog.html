            <h3 class="blogcardtitle">What is responsive site, and why is responsiveness important.</h3>
            <p>
                    a responsive site is one that resizes on different devices. if you were to visit the site on a device with a smaller resolution the different elements should change to accommodate it. if for example there isnt enough space for a navigation bar on the side of the screen when you resize, it would disappear and set up a toolbar at the top.

        <div class="blogcard ">  
            <h3 class="blogcardtitle">What is mobile first design, and why is it important.</h3> 
            <p>
                    mobile first design is designing on the smallest size resolution first. this is important as if you develop a site from the smallest resolution possible and then build outwards, you'll find yourself able to manipulate the different elements much easier. at a certian point with resolutions it doesn't matter how large the screen is, it will always look the same. with mobiles there can always be a smaller res that you need to anticipate.

            <h3 class="blogcardtitle">What are frameworks, and what are their pros and cons.</h3>
            <p>
                    frameworks are a structure to your website that allow the use of similar classes throughout the whole site. they are handy to use as you know exactly what you're going to get when you start breaking your site down into grids. to use a wireframe structure means to understand how your selected structure operates and to build around maximizing efficiency for it. The cons to using frameworks however are that they are extremely hard to deviate from. if you want to use a framework that implements a certian container for the info you want, but that style is not what you were hoping to accomplish, it can be tricky to circumvent the selected framework's rules.

        <div class="blogcard ">  
            <h3 class="blogcardtitle">What is a wireframe is and why we use it.</h3>
            <p>
                    a wireframe is an initial layout of the website that you are trying to create. You use it to make sure you know what elements will be contained in what way, and if any are nestled into another. you try to draw up your wireframe with the framework (if you are using one) in mind. It's important to draw out your frameworks a few times in respect to the different devices your site may be used on. once you have a good wireframe set up it makes the coding of your site very easy, as you can go down the wireframes from top level all the way down to semanitc code before you start filling it out with information.

            <h3 class="blogcardtitle">What did I find difficult about using wireframes?</h3>
            <p>
                I find it hard to implement the use of frameworks to implement the wireframe design I created. I found myself trying to alter the skeleton framework that I installed more than I thought, while re-designing my website. The design had a few features that were unprioritised when it came to the css, favoring the skeleton css over the ideas I was trying to get across, and so I had to spend a bit of time trying to find reliable ways to circumvent them that didn't ruin the code.
