            <h3 class="blogcardtitle">What is grid based design?</h3>
            <p>
                Grid based design is the structuring a web page as a grid. each row is an initialisation of a .row class in an element, and each column is a .col-# class. the columns fit nestle into each row, and depending on the sizing of the column, it changes the size it fits into it. every column size is based off of a multiple of 12, as 12 has the most readily available factors to divide into, in order to section off a page. by doing this you can set aside different sizes for each box you will end up using, and it keeps everything in the page uniform. using a grid based design means knowing how much of a page is going to be delegated space by using these grid/column techniques.

            <h3 class="blogcardtitle">Whats all the hype about responsive webpages?</h3>
            <p>
                Since a webpage can be accessed by many different devices, with wildly differing resolutions, one setup of a webpage in terms of sizing is not going to work with every device. even if one resolution was standard across all devices, the act of resizing a window means that elements in a webpage will shift around dramatically. Creating a responsive webpage is extremely important to make sure the content is readable  and understandable in any size screen or window. by setting different parts of a page to react differently when you rezize, you can make sure a user is able to navigate around your size efficiently.

            <h3 class="blogcardtitle">What is semantic structure?</h3>
            <p>
                Semantic structure is the use of the various built-in tags for html. tags like &lt;h1&gt;,&lt;p&gt;	etc. these are defined as semantic tags as the names accurately describe what their use is (&lt;h1&gt; for header one, &lt;p&gt; for paragraph). each of these tags has default properties before any css style is applied to them. by using these tags you are able to determine what a section of your code's value is extremely easily when viewing the html.

            <h3 class="blogcardtitle">Any other points you found interesting and want to reflect on?</h3>
            <p>
                I wonder if this is the standard for all websites out there, or if there are different variations on this concept. It would be interesting to find out if there are entirely new structures when it comes to the layout of a web page. I do like this grid based design though as it seems to drill right to the core concepts of scaling pages.
