          <h3 class="blogcardtitle">How does life look through the 'pleasure, passion and purpose' lens?</h3>
          <p>
             Being honest, at the moment Life doesn't look 100% perfect looking at my life through this type of outlook. I need to find a higher purpose in life to make sure what I do is more memorable. Currently I feel I put more effort into the pleasure aspect of happiness and don't necessarily find time for the others. For passion, I do feel I'm ok in this aspect. Prior to starting this course I was very engaged in my work, and was content in what I was doing. I enjoyed it but it I realised that it was probably a bit more stressful than I was hoping. I think I should focus on passion in my self discovery before I try to determine a higher purpose of my life.

          <h3 class="blogcardtitle"> What are your core values?  What do you stand for?</h3>
          <p>
            Man, this is a tougher question to answer than I thought it was going to be. Are my core values what I look for in myself, or I feel I currently posess, or are they what I look for in other people? I guess What i value about myself is my reserved nature. I don't look for a fight, I don't get upset about things that may cause stress in others in the same position. I like to think of myself as grounded. I look for the same in other people. I work well with people who have levels of chill to them, and I respect people who can take a step back from something and put their ego aside. I think I stand for kindness. So many times I've seen people with little or no regard for others in the same room, and it definitely irks me. I know I'm no "Saint Kindness", and do put myself first in certian scenarios, But if it's something that meditation can help me with I can try improve my empathy.

            <h3 class="blogcardtitle"> How did you find the resilience ideas and meditation exercise? Was there anything else in the chapter that piqued your attention?</h3>
            <p>
                The ideas I agree with. You never realise how much actively studying how you act in certian circumstances can change your outlook on everything you do. I definitely found it wierd switching so quickly from a "sad place" to a "happy place", but I guess as with everything it's something that will improve with practice. It however does feel great to understand all the physical changes that occur when you are in each of these states. muscles going from tense to relaxed, having an extremely busy brain thinking about negative thoughts, then going to a zen thought process with all your happy thoughts. It reminds me of the Circuit training excercises a few chapters back, but with more self reflection and a deeper understanding of your reactance.
