                What I like about this style is how everything is centred in the page. Compacting the text and images and using a heavy amount of white space gives the site a sleek look. The use of images as a border instead of just using the built in border types also frames the whole page very well.

                   The great thing about this site is the title box. everything is structured out extremely elegantly. the slight borders that run through the whole page works well to distinguish between each of the different texts. also having boxes with information about the site running down the right-hand side of the site with slight deviations in style is a great way of structuring.

        <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</h3>
        <p>
            The structure of a website is similar to a tree. The document object model can be represented as the trunk and main branches of the tree. It is the base of the website layout and will structure every page to make sure that each HTML Page, CSS file, and anything else that will be hosted on the website is where it's supposed to be.
            The HTML pages in this analogy would then be the leaves. In this case, each of the different leaves be a different site  page. each of the pages/leaves are most likely structured in a different way to one another, but follow a similar pattern (ie. all the leaves on the tree are wide on one tree vs narrow leaves on another.
            CSS would be the type of tree it is. thickness of the branches,color of the leaves etc. certian elements may play different parts, some of the leaves at the top of the tree may be thinner than those at the bottom etc.

        <h3>What is meant by boxifying design?</h3>
        <p>
            A boxifying design is one that is carefully and concisely seperated into segments. the main text of the page will most likely be housed in a main box, and any deviations to this body, for example pictures, will need another box inside that box. Titles, navigation sidebars, login boxes will all be contained in it's own box. ultimately when you finish creating a website you should be able to distinguish what elements are contained in which box.
            
        </p>
        <h3>What is the box model?</h3>
        <p>
            The box model is the structure of the webpage. You have the main page, and from there you may branch your page into two boxes, one for the title and one for the body. you keep going in this way until everything is sectioned off in your page. if you were to draw a diagram of the pages structure you'll notice the different nestled boxes in one another, instead of having an element open, then close, then have another element open and close, until you reach the end of the page.
