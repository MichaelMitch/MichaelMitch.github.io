          <h3 class="blogcardtitle">When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h3>
          <p>
              One of my triggers is when I'm trying to solve an issue that's taking me a while to achieve. I usually get stressed out when I've tried a bunch of different things to get something working and it doesn't work. Usually when this happens I realise the time that it's taking to sort it out it much longer than I anticipated and start worrying about that too. I worry sometimes that I'm not retaining the information as I write out the sprints.

          <h3 class="blogcardtitle">How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h3>
          <p>
              It definitely helped. I had an experience that started to upset me right after reading the chapter. I used the skills taught in it to overcome my distress in response to the situation. Stopping to realise that you are currently distressed helped to detatch myself from my worries so that I could better come to terms with it. By allowing myself space to collect myself and switch focus on why I was feeling this way and the ways that I could look at the situation in a more postitive light, I was able to realise that I was judging myself based off of others, and that this was an unhealthy thing to do. after realising that I immediately noticed my body calm down.
