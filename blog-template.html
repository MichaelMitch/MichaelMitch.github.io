        <h3 class="blogcardtitle">Which timebox and habits techniques did you try?</h3>
        <p>
            I have tried the meditation techniques. I find dedicating ~20 minutes after any lengthy workload that I do helps to come out of focus from the task I was working on.
            Sitting still and letting my mind rest helps declutter. It is pretty difficult trying to stop thinking about what I was working on, or any other external
            pressures in life, but as with anything if I work on it it should get easier
            I'm working on trying to focus my time in smaller sections, instead of trying to tackle the bigger picture. sectioning off the sprints and making sure 
            I can get them done in the time alloted seems to be the way to go. I've found some good management apps to plan this with.

        <h3 class="blogcardtitle">What did you find interesting?</h3>
        <p>
            The pomadoro method seems like something to try. I usually prefer to sit down and work for lengthy amounts of time instead of taking small breaks
            inbetween, as I find it hard to jump back into whatever I was working on. It does seem like a good way to re-orientate myself on what I am working on and to structure out where I should be ending up.
            Keeping the growth mindset idea in the forefront of my work seems like something I should do. I should start thinking more on the skills i'm developing and will develop instead of what I already know.

        <h3 class="blogcardtitle">What worked for you?</h3>
        <p>
            The meditation definitely worked well in easing myself out of my work state. It also works as a good tool to end a timebox session. I structure it as reflection on my work first, then calm myself down by meditation.
            Sectioning off the work that I am trying to accomplish into bits works well by taking the work-in a structuring out the time needed to complete it and when/where I should dedicate the most of my time and resources to.
            Doing so I feel more at ease about the workload and as long as I follow the plan I can make sure I am on track.

        <h3 class="blogcardtitle">which will you experiment further with?</h3>
        <p>
            I'll start by trying to build up my work habits. If I can follow the proper regiments, and keep myself in check I should find myself easing into a proper and structured schedule.
            I'll work on setting some solid reflection time. I'll find a good place to do this in terms of documenting what I have done, what I should work on etc. 
            With any large amount of work that is given, I'll make sure that I am entirely devoted to it to get myself in a state of focus. Building the ablility to know when to section work up and to just knuckle down I will work on.
            With smaller workloads I'll make sure to reflect on what I've accomplished when I've completed it.
